 Speedy Web Apps with Cloudinary Image Optimization
</h1>

Cloudinary is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution for managing all your web or mobile application’s media assets in
the cloud. Cloudinary offers an end-to-end solution for all your image and video needs, including the upload, storage,
administration, transformation and optimized delivery.

## Introduction

In this article, we will demonstrate how one can use Cloudinary to speed up their web apps. At the end of this article we will have a web application that loads faster retains more users and provides a better user experience.

## PHPSandbox and Github

The final project can be viewed on [PHPSandbox](https://phpsandbox.io/e/x/nuopv?&layout=EditorPreview&iframeId=61ihmshq1o&theme=dark&defaultPath=/&showExplorer=no&openedFiles=/app/Http/Livewire/FileUpload.php) and the entire source code is available on my [Github](https://github.com/victorokech/cloudinary-content-aware) repository.

## Prerequisites

Using Cloudinary in your Laravel projects is pretty straightforward. However, for you to be able to easily follow along,
you need to have a good command of your terminal, Git and entry knowledge of PHP specifically with the Laravel
framework.

## Getting Started

This assumes you already have composer installed. Laravel uses Composer to manage its dependencies. So, before we can
start ensure you have Composer installed on your machine.

1. Install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and [PHP](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.windows.tools.php) on
   your development or production machine.
2. Install Laravel
    1. Via Composer:

       `composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel cloudinary-content-aware`
    2. Via Laravel Installer

       `composer global require laravel/installer`

       `laravel new cloudinary-content-aware`
3. In step 2 above we have created a project folder called `cloudinary-content-aware`. Change the directory to this
   project folder and run the local development server by typing the following commands:

   `cd cloudinary-content-aware`

   `php artisan serve`

The Laravel Project is now up and running.

## Setting up Cloudinary’s Laravel SDK

Using Cloudinary allows you to optimize the performance of your Laravel backend by allowing you to upload, process, and
deliver your media files. Cloudinary servers automatically perform optimizations and scales to handle high loads and
bursts of traffic with a global content delivery network (CDN) feature. This is great for our media platform.

To implement a content-aware crop for our media files with Cloudinary:

1. Sign up for a free Cloudinary account then navigate to the Console page and take note of your Cloud name, API Key and
   API Secret.


![Cloudinary Dashboard](https://res.cloudinary.com/dgrpkngjn/image/upload/v1655885646/content-aware/assets/cloudinary_dashboard_pditxk.png)


3. Install [Cloudinary’s Laravel SDK](https://github.com/cloudinary-labs/cloudinary-laravel#installation):

   `composer require cloudinary-labs/cloudinary-laravel`

**Note**: Please ensure you follow all the steps in the #Installation section. Publish the configuration file and add
the Cloudinary credentials you noted in Step 1 to the .env file.

## Uploading Image Files

We will be using the Laravel package Livewire to build the UI and the image file upload functionality.

1. Install Livewire Package by running the following command in your Laravel project:

   `composer require livewire/livewire`


2. Include Livewire scripts and styles on every page that will be using Livewire. In our case `welcome.blade.php`:
```html
...
    @livewireStyles
</head>
<body>
    ...
    
    @livewireScripts
</body>
</html>
```
3. We will then create a Livewire Component to handle our file uploads:

   `php artisan make:livewire FileUpload`

This will create two files, one in `app/Http/Livewire/FileUpload` and the other one
in `resources/views/livewire/file-upload.blade.php`

Now you can use this component anywhere in your Laravel project using the following snippet:

`<livewire:file-upload/>`

or

`@livewire(‘file-upload’)`

3. Open `resources/views/welcome.blade.php` and add the following code within the `<body></body>` tags as shown below:

```html
<body class="antialiased">
  <div>
    @livewire('file-upload')
  </div>
</body>
```

This basically includes the Livewire component we created earlier into our `welcome.blade.php`.

**Note:** Please ensure you go through the [Livewire documentation](https://laravel-livewire.com/docs/2.x/quickstart), to learn how to install and set it up.

3. Open the file `resources/views/livewire/file-upload.blade.php` and populate it with the following code:

```html
<form class="mb-5" wire:submit.prevent="upload">
    <div class="form-group row mt-5 mb-3">
        <div class="input-group">
            <input type="file" class="form-control @error('media') is-invalid @enderror"
                   placeholder="Choose file..." id="media-file" type="file" wire:model="media">
            @error('media')
            <div class="invalid-feedback">{{ $message }}</div>
            @enderror
        </div>
        <small class="text-muted text-center mt-2" wire:loading wire:target="media">
            {{ __('Uploading') }}&hellip;
        </small>
    </div>
    <div class="text-center">
        <button type="submit" class="btn btn-sm btn-primary w-25">
            <i class="fas fa-check mr-1"></i> {{ __('Crop') }}
        </button>
    </div>
</form>

<div class="container">
    <div class="row">
        @foreach($croppedImages as $key => $link)
        <div class="col-sm mb-4">
            <div class="card">
                <div class="card-body">
                    <img class="card-img-top" src="{{ $link }}" alt="Card image cap">
                    <h5 class="card-title mt-4 fw-bold">
                        {{ $key }}
                    </h5>
                    @if($key == '1:1')
                    <p>Image Aspect Ratio 1:1</p>
                    <p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Facebook, Instagram</p>
                    @elseif($key == '2:1' || $key == '16:10')
                    <p>Image Aspect Ratio 2:1, 16:10</p>
                    <p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Twitter, LinkedIn</p>
                    @endif
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        @endforeach
    </div>
</div>
```

This is our Livewire Component view, this basically will show the upload media file form and on successful processing
through Cloudinary will display the media file uploaded perfectly cropped for the different aspect ratios we will
specify.

The first part of the code above is a form with an input of type file and a submit button.

The second part will take the response from Cloudinary and display the optimized and transformed images in the aspect ratios we specified in our code.

**Note:** you will see the implementation in code shortly.

4. Open the file `app/Http/Livewire/FileUpload.php`. Here, we are going to add a method that will upload an image to
   Cloudinary applying the necessary transformations that we need. Add the following code in this file.
    1. First we use Livewires `WithFileUploads` to help us with file uploads, then create two variables `$media`
       and `$croppedImages` which is an array that will contain the image URLs we get back from Cloudinary.
   ```php
    use Livewire\WithFileUploads;
    
    public $media;
    public $croppedImages = [];
    ```
    2. Secondly, we will create the function that will upload the image file to [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com) and
       apply specified transformations which include the aspect rations that we need.
   ```php
   public function upload() {
    $data = $this->validate([
      'media' => ['required',
                    'image',
                    'mimes:jpeg,jpg,png',],]);
    if (empty($data['media'])) {
      unset($data['media']);
    } else {
      $media = $data['media'];
      $aspect_ratio = ['1:1', '2:1', '16:10'];
      foreach ($aspect_ratio as $ac) {
        $image = cloudinary()->upload($media->getRealPath(), [
          'folder'         => 'cloudinary-content-aware',
          'transformation' => [
            'quality'      => 'auto',
            'fetch_format'      => 'auto',
            'aspect_ratio' => $ac,
            'gravity'      => 'faces',
            'crop'         => 'fill'
          ]])->getSecurePath();
    
        $this->croppedImages[$ac] = $image;
      }
    }
   
    session()->flash('message', 'Image file cropped successfully!');
   }  
   ```
   The code above, slated for image files with focus items for instance faces, will automagically focus on the people's faces or any focus items and perform content aware cropping and resizing of the image based on our parameters. Better still, Cloudinary will also automatically optimize the image size with no compromise in quality. This is done by setting the `auto` value for the `quality` and `fetch_format` attributes.

If you successfully implemented the code above, you should be able to see the following when you navigate to your project on the browser:

![Cloudinary Content Aware Crop Media Platform](https://res.cloudinary.com/dgrpkngjn/image/upload/v1655885646/content-aware/assets/cloudinary_content_aware_xasqfu.png)

**Note:** Cloudinary is super powerful for the management of your media assets in your project that will not only optimize your assets for visual quality but also cost savings in terms of performance, storage, AI powered transformations as well.
